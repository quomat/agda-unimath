## Idea

The telephone numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that count the way `n`
telephone lines can be connected to each other, where each line can be connected
to at most one other line. They also occur in several other combinatorics
problems.

## Definitions

```agda
telephone-number : ℕ → ℕ
telephone-number zero-ℕ = {!!}
telephone-number (succ-ℕ zero-ℕ) = {!!}
telephone-number (succ-ℕ (succ-ℕ n)) = {!!}
```
