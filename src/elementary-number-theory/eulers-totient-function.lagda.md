## Idea

**Euler's totient function** `φ : ℕ → ℕ` is the function that maps a
[natural number](elementary-number-theory.natural-numbers.md) `n` to the number
of
[multiplicative units modulo `n`](elementary-number-theory.multiplicative-units-standard-cyclic-rings.md).
In other words, the number `φ n` is the cardinality of the
[group of units](ring-theory.groups-of-units-rings.md) of the
[ring](ring-theory.rings.md) `ℤ-Mod n`.

Alternatively, Euler's totient function can be defined as the function `ℕ → ℕ`
that returns for each `n` the number of `x < n` that are
[relatively prime](elementary-number-theory.relatively-prime-natural-numbers.md).
These two definitions of Euler's totient function agree on the _positive_
natural numbers. However, there are two multiplicative units in the
[ring `ℤ`](elementary-number-theory.ring-of-integers.md) of
[integers](elementary-number-theory.integers.md), while there are no natural
numbers `x < 0` that are relatively prime to `0`.

Our reason for preferring the first definition over the second definition is
that the usual properties of Euler's totient function, such as multiplicativity,
extend naturally to the first definition.
