## Idea

A [partial element](foundation.partial-elements.md) `a` of `A` is said to be
{{#concept "total" Disambiguation="partial element"}} if it is defined. The type
of total partial elements of `A` is
[equivalent](foundation-core.equivalences.md) to the type `A`.

## Definitions

### The type of total partial elements

```agda
total-partial-element :
  {l1 : Level} (l2 : Level) (A : UU l1) → UU (l1 ⊔ lsuc l2)
total-partial-element l2 A = {!!}
```
