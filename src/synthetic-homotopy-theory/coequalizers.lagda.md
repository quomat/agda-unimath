## Idea

The **coequalizer** of a parallel pair `f, g : A → B` is the colimiting
[cofork](synthetic-homotopy-theory.coforks.md), i.e. a cofork with the
[universal property of coequalizers](synthetic-homotopy-theory.universal-property-coequalizers.md).

## Properties

### All parallel pairs admit a coequalizer

The **canonical coequalizer** may be obtained as a
[pushout](synthetic-homotopy-theory.pushouts.md) of the span

```text
     ∇         [f,g]
A <----- A + A -----> B
```

where the left map is the
[codiagonal map](foundation.codiagonal-maps-of-types.md), sending `inl(a)` and
`inr(a)` to `a`, and the right map is defined by the universal property of
[coproducts](foundation.coproduct-types.md) to send `inl(a)` to `f(a)` and
`inr(a)` to `g(a)`.

The pushout thus constructed will consist of a copy of `B`, a copy of `A`, and
for every point `a` of `A` there will be a path from `f(a)` to `a` and to
`g(a)`, which corresponds to having a copy of `B` with paths connecting every
`f(a)` to `g(a)`.

The construction from pushouts itself is an implementation detail, which is why
the definition is marked abstract.

```agda
module _
  { l1 l2 : Level} {A : UU l1} {B : UU l2} (f g : A → B)
  where

  abstract
    canonical-coequalizer : UU (l1 ⊔ l2)
    canonical-coequalizer = {!!}

    cofork-canonical-coequalizer : cofork f g canonical-coequalizer
    cofork-canonical-coequalizer = {!!}

    dup-canonical-coequalizer :
      { l : Level} →
      dependent-universal-property-coequalizer l f g
        ( cofork-canonical-coequalizer)
    dup-canonical-coequalizer = {!!}

    up-canonical-coequalizer :
      { l : Level} →
      universal-property-coequalizer l f g cofork-canonical-coequalizer
    up-canonical-coequalizer = {!!}
