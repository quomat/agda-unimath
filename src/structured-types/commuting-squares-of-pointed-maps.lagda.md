## Idea

A coherence square of pointed maps

```text
  A ------> X
  |         |
  |         |
  |         |
  V         V
  B ------> Y
```

is a coherence of the underlying square of (unpointed) maps, plus a coherence
between the pointedness preservation proofs.

## Definition

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 l3 l4 : Level}
  {A : Pointed-Type l1} {B : Pointed-Type l2}
  {C : Pointed-Type l3} {X : Pointed-Type l4}
  (top : C →∗ B) (left : C →∗ A) (right : B →∗ X) (bottom : A →∗ X)
  where

  coherence-square-pointed-maps : UU (l3 ⊔ l4)
  coherence-square-pointed-maps = {!!}

  coherence-square-maps-coherence-square-pointed-maps :
    coherence-square-pointed-maps →
    coherence-square-maps
      ( map-pointed-map top)
      ( map-pointed-map left)
      ( map-pointed-map right)
      ( map-pointed-map bottom)
  coherence-square-maps-coherence-square-pointed-maps = {!!}
