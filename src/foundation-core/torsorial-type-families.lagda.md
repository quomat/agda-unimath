## Idea

A type family `B` over `A` is said to be **torsorial** if its
[total space](foundation.dependent-pair-types.md) is
[contractible](foundation-core.contractible-types.md).

The terminology of torsorial type families is derived from torsors of higher
group theory, which are type families `X : BG ‚Üí ùí∞` with contractible total
space. In the conventional sense of the word, a torsor is therefore a torsorial
type family over a
[pointed connected type](higher-group-theory.higher-groups.md). If we drop the
condition that they are defined over a pointed connected type, we get to the
notion of 'torsor-like', or indeed 'torsorial' type families.

## Definition

### The predicate of being a torsorial type family

```agda
is-torsorial :
  {l1 l2 : Level} {B : UU l1} ‚Üí (B ‚Üí UU l2) ‚Üí UU (l1 ‚äî l2)
is-torsorial = {!!}
```
