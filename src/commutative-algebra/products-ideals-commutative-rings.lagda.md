## Idea

The **product** of two [ideals](commutative-algebra.ideals-commutative-rings.md)
`I` and `J` in a [commutative ring](commutative-algebra.commutative-rings.md) is
the ideal generated all products of elements in `I` and `J`.

## Definition

### The universal property of the product of two ideals in a commutative ring

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 l3 : Level} (R : Commutative-Ring l1)
  (I : ideal-Commutative-Ring l2 R) (J : ideal-Commutative-Ring l3 R)

  contains-product-ideal-Commutative-Ring :
    {l4 : Level} (K : ideal-Commutative-Ring l4 R) → UU (l1 ⊔ l2 ⊔ l3 ⊔ l4)
  contains-product-ideal-Commutative-Ring = {!!}

  is-product-ideal-Commutative-Ring :
    {l4 : Level} (K : ideal-Commutative-Ring l4 R) →
    contains-product-ideal-Commutative-Ring K → UUω
  is-product-ideal-Commutative-Ring = {!!}

### The ideal generated by a product of two subsets is the product of the ideals generated by the two subsets

In other words, we will show that `(S)(T) = {!!}

### The product of ideals is assiciative

Given three ideals `I`, `J`, and `K`, we have that

```text
  (IJ)K ＝ ((generating-subset-product-ideal-Commutative-Ring I J)K)
        ＝ (I(generating-subset-product-ideal-Commutative-Ring J K))
        ＝ I(JK).
